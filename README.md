#Bright! Energy Services

Live Demo: http://alyrichardson.com/ell-bright

This sample home page was created on the Polaris SASS starter, authored by 40Digits (I helped a bit with its creation while I worked there).

##Files

The entire layout of the homepage is stored in:
./index.html

Javascript used:

./assets/js/script.js
JQuery external library

The specific styles for this project are located in:

./_src/sass/layout/_nav
./_src/sass/layout/_main
./_src/sass/layout/_footer
./_src/sass/settings/_icons

Options and values were added in:

./_src/sass/settings/_colors
./_src/sass/settings/_options


The Polaris framework uses ./_src/sass/style.scss to compile and convert from SCSS to CSS and outputs to ./assets/css/style.css
